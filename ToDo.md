# Things to do....

Deal with cardNumbers for borrowers....
  
Convert return a book to a simple but time triggered rapid file single
text entry form.

Duplicate to the borrowers Info page (alternating between return and
take-out a book).

Add inventory using similar layout (but add shelf id).

---

When you try to delete a class which still has people in it, we need to
pop up a dismissable modal window.

Add user-barcodes and add to borrowers finders.

Finish HelpPages together with edit ability for slib

Work through allowing general pages (which do not require slib to be
logged in)

Fix hx-targets
