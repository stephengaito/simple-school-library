# Simple School Library

We build a simple school library using:

- [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/)

- [Jinja](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/3.0.x/)

- [</> htmx](https://htmx.org/)

- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)

  - For development, this requires the [Standalone CLI: Use Tailwind CSS
    without Node.js - Tailwind
    CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/blog/standalone-cli) to be downloaded
    from the [Releases Â·
    tailwindlabs/tailwindcss](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/releases)
    page and placed somewhere in your $PATH.
